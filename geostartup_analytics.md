# GeoStartup Analytics  
*Data + ML Portfolio — Geospatial Startup Mapping*

## Overview  
This project visualizes global startup ecosystems using geospatial analytics. I combined funding and geographic data to generate interactive maps, heatmaps, and regional cluster plots.

## What I Did  
- Merged startup funding data with latitude–longitude points.  
- Built an interactive Folium map with funding overlays.  
- Applied K-Means clustering to identify regional patterns.  
- Created a global heatmap of startup density.

## How I Did It  
Using `folium`, `sklearn`, and `pandas`, I generated tile-based interactive maps and cluster visualizations. Heatmaps highlight hotspots like Silicon Valley, Bangalore, Berlin, and Singapore.

## Why It Matters  
Startup activity is geographically concentrated. This tool makes it easy to explore global entrepreneurship landscapes and identify high-density innovation clusters.
